<h4>Special Testcase</h4>

The data for this case consists of <strong>5000</strong> points and a copy can be found in the analysis folder as <code>specialcase.txt</code> <br/>
This case took approximately <strong>47 seconds</strong> to completely triangulate. <br/>

Convex hull has been computed and triangulated: <br/>

<h3>Closing Comments</h3>

<h4>Computing the convex hull</h4>
The hull is computed using Andrew's Algorithm by default, and imports the code from assignment 1 in order to achieve this. The constructor can be made to accept an int as an optional parameter based on which <br/>
the specific algorithm to be used can be decided from among Andrew's, Graham's and Jarvis. <br/>
<h4>Triangulating the Hull</h4>
By the very definition of a convex hull, it must ALWAYS be a monotone polygon. Thus, our previous issues with triangulating a polygon don't bother us here. <br/>
<h4>Insertion of points</h4>
The (i+1)th point being inserted iterates over <code>2*i - points_on_hull - 2 </code> points in the worst case. Once the containing triangle is found, there are 3 additions and one deletion from our list of polygons. Each of these operations are constant time<br/>
The final triangulation varies based on the order of points in the input since they are not sorted before looping. <br/> <br/>
<u><strong>Degeneracies:</u></strong><br/>
Points on the edge of triangles lie in two triangles. The current code has a break statement and doesn't connect the vertex in the other triangle. This means that the triangle to which it connects is chosen by the order of input.<br/>
<u><strong>Complexity:</u></strong><br/>
The first two steps are <code> O(n log n) </code> but the final step with <code> O(n^2) </code> decides the overall complexity. <br/>
<u><strong>Robustness:</u></strong><br/>
The convex hull computed is always monotone, so the only issues of robustness occur in the 3rd subroutine. <br/>
